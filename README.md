# DocIT

## Objective:
### The project aims to connect doctors and patients during lockdown via online technology. During the pandemic, since no one could go outside, people had to resort to video conferencing with their doctors in case of any medical emergency and guidance. Widespread use of video conferencing platforms like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc. has become prevalent during the lockdown period. Previously there have been applications like Practo that allow the user to connect with a doctor.

## Implementation: 
### With this project, we aim at developing a multipurpose one-for-all website that provides a variety of features to the user. Our website will inculcate the following features:

#### Login and Signup Pages for both Patient and Doctor as well as Admin

#### Doctor verification via a special link that takes the doctor's email and sends them a link for a form. This can be checked by the admin team to make sure that only legitimate doctors are coming to the website.

#### Video and chat conferencing with the doctor of preference

#### Latest Health Related News

#### Calendar for the Doctor and Patient to check for their appointments

#### Scheduling new appointments at any time

#### Feature that allows the doctor to cancel any appointment, which will be followed by email notification to the patient. This email contains a link for the rescheduling page, through which the patient can alter their appointment time.

#### An FAQ bot that allows the user to ask questions related to the app

#### We have also implemented a Voice Assistant that allows the user to go to any page on the website.

#### The doctor can also write a prescription to the patient while conducting the meeting. This can be later printed by the patient for future reference.

## Applications: 
### In these Covid-19 related times, physical appointments with doctors can be a threat to both the patient and the doctors life. By providing online consultation facility, we reduce this risk extensively. - We are focussing more on user experience by providing all the functionalities in a single app giving users the ease of access.

## Instructions:
### The entire application has been hosted on the link provided. 

### The application can be also run on the local system. Although, to run a few components installation of node.js and npm is required. The standard node.js installation will allow the successful running of features like the voice control, chat section and video call section. 

### The entire database is set up on Remote MySQL. 
### Features like chatbot have been created using Azure Functionalities. Also,  the cluster for the MongoDB is hosted on Azure
### Nutrition analysis and voice control have been made made using respective APIs.

## Future Scope: 
### We would be scaling the app enabling higher number of users and seemless functionality implementation. - We would be improving the security of the application by enabling two factor authentication on multiple access points. - We would restrict the chat functionality between the doctor and the patient to a certain number of days. After the query period is exceeded the patient will have to pay an additional fee to consult the doctor via chat for the previous appointment. There is a transcript function that will allow the user to refer to the appointment once it is over. This is happening at the back end but the saving and viewing of this transcript has been kept as a future scope.
