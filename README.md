# DocIT

## Objective:
### The project aims to connect doctors and patients during lockdown via online technology. During the pandemic, since no one could go outside, people had to resort to video conferencing with their doctors in case of any medical emergency and guidance. Widespread use of video conferencing platforms like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc. has become prevalent during the lockdown period. Previously there have been applications like Practo that allow the user to connect with a doctor.

## Implentation: 
### With this project, we aim at developing a multipurpose one-for-all website that provides a variety of features to the user. Our website will inculcate the following features:

#### Login and Signup Pages for both Patient and Doctor as well as Admin

#### Doctor verification via a special link that takes the doctor's email and sends them a link for a form. This can be checked by the admin team to make sure that only legitimate doctors are coming to the website.

#### Video and chat conferencing with the doctor of preference

#### Latest Health Related News

#### Calendar for the Doctor and Patient to check for their appointments

#### Scheduling new appointments at any time

#### Feature that allows the doctor to cancel any appointment, which will be followed by email notification to the patient. This email contains a link for the rescheduling page, through which the patient can alter their appointment time.

#### An FAQ bot that allows the user to ask questions related to the app

#### We have also implemented a Voice Assistant that allows the user to go to any page on the website.

#### More detail about the feature list and implementation can be found in the file attached.

## Applications: 
### In these Covid-19 related times, physical appointments with doctors can be a threat to both the patient and the doctors life. By providing online consultation facility, we reduce this risk extensively. - We are focussing more on user experience by providing all the functionalities in a single app giving users the ease of access.

## Future Scope: 
### We would be scaling the app enabling higher number of users and seemless functionality implementation. - We would be improving the security of the application by enabling two factor authentication on multiple access points. - We would restrict the chat functionality between the doctor and the patient to a certain number of days. After the query period is exceeded the patient will have to pay an additional fee to consult the doctor via chat for the previous appointment.
